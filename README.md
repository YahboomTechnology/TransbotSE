![]([https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/TransbotSE/blob/main/TransbotSE_Yahboom.jpg])
# Introduction
TRANSBOT-SE is a tracked robot car developed based on the robot operating system. The entire body is made of aluminum alloy. Equipped with a 3-DOF robotic arm and a 2-DOF camera PTZ, 520 encoder motors, and a large-capacity battery. It is compatible with Jetson Nano B01 and Raspberry Pi 5. Built-in OpenCV image processing algorithm, MediaPipe machine learning, AI deep learning framework, and movelt simulation platform, Transbot SE can realize functions such as robot motion control, gesture recognition, object recognition, tracking, automatic driving, and robotic arm simulation control.
# Features
* Crawler structure, the whole vehicle is made of all-aluminum alloy, and comes with HQ crawler and high-power motor.
* 2DOF 2MP camera, combined with APP or remote control handle, it can realize real-time transmission of video.
* 3DOF robotic arm, which can not only realize the gripping and handling function of the robotic arm, but also realize MoveIt simulation.
* Based on the ROS operating system, adopt Python programing, support Jetson Nano B01 and Raspberry Pi 5.
* Through Opencv image processing and MediaPipe framework, it realizes a series of functions related to AI visual recognition.
